This is a practice dataset I am working on to get better with my datascience skills.

**FORD CAR PRICE PREDICTION ANALYSIS**
DETAILS:
1. About


The **ford.csv** file contains the various types of Ford cars, their year, fuel type, engine size etc.
The dataset describes the Types of Ford car there are, their Year of useage, Transmission type, their mileage(number of miles travelled or covered), it's mpg (miles per gallon thus,how many miles a car can go on a gallon).

PHASE1

The relevant python packages are imported and used to make analysis thus (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, etc). These packages will help us with our analysis as they provide the relevant libraries needed to breakdown our dataset and start making meaningful analysis of our data set.
The **sns.set_theme(color_codes=True)** is a seaborn package that tells the default styling options of visualizations and plots in data analysis.
The **set_theme()** is a function in Seaborn that allows you to custormise the visual styles of your plots and visualizatons 


PHASE2

Preprocessing stage: Getting basic relevant information about our "ford.csv" data. 
Here, the data is prepared and made ready for analysis. Incorrect inputs are monitored, missing values are checked and removed including duplicates (If only duplicates will not affect the entire result of our dataset with it analysis).
